### The Original Automated ROM Deheaderer
## About
DeheadEmAll or DHEA is the original automated ROM deheaderer. Some ROM sets conatin headered ROMs, some sets contain deheadered ROMs. Use this software to deheader your headered ROMs.  
  
DeheadEmAll comes with both a command line interface and a graphical interface. No matter which interface you choose, deheadering all of your ROMs is easy. Just run DeheadEmAll to deheader all of your ROMs.  
  
Probably the easiest way to deheader your ROMs is to just put your ROMs into the ROMs directory and run DeheadEmAll to deheader everything using the following parameters:  
  
- (.fds) - Nintendo Famicom Disk System files will be deheadered.
- (.nes) - Nintendo Entertainment System files will be deheadered.
- (.a78) - Atari 7800 files will be deheadered.
- (.lnx) - Atari Lynx files will be deheadered.
- No other files will be deheadered.  
- No original files will be moved or deleted.  
- Deheadered ROMs will be placed in the ROMsDeheaded directory overwriting any existing deheadered ROMs with the same name.  
  
If you happen to like bullshit, DeheadEmAll can also accept commands and options from the command line. For command line help, run the -help command.
