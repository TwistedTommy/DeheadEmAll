[I] About
---------------------------------------------------------------
DeheadEmAll or DHEA is the original automated ROM deheaderer. Some ROM sets conatin headered ROMs, some sets contain deheadered ROMs. Use this software to deheader your headered ROMs.

DeheadEmAll comes with both a command line interface and a graphical interface. No matter which interface you choose, deheadering all of your ROMs is easy. Just run DeheadEmAll to deheader all of your ROMs.

Probably the easiest way to deheader your ROMs is to just put your ROMs into the ROMs directory and run DeheadEmAll to deheader everything using the following parameters:

- (.fds) - Nintendo Famicom Disk System files will be deheadered.
- (.nes) - Nintendo Entertainment System files will be deheadered.
- (.a78) - Atari 7800 files will be deheadered.
- (.lnx) - Atari Lynx files will be deheadered.
- ROMs in all sub directories will be recursively deheadered.
- No original ROMs will be moved or deleted.
- Deheadered ROMs will be placed in the ROMsDeheaded directory overwriting any existing deheadered ROMs with the same name.

If you happen to like bullshit, DeheadEmAll can also accept commands and options from the command line. For command line help, run the -help command.

[II] Requirements
---------------------------------------------------------------
This software has been tested and verified working on Windows, Linux and Mac using .Net 4.7.2 or Mono.

[III] Installation
---------------------------------------------------------------
Download and unzip the program to any location that you wish to use. However, this software should be installed as close to the drive's root directory as possible.

I like to put my installation in a directory called DHEA on my C:\ drive. My installation layout looks like this:

C:\DHEA\Batches\
C:\DHEA\Docs\
C:\DHEA\Logs\
C:\DHEA\ROMs\
C:\DHEA\ROMsDeheaded\
C:\DHEA\DeheadEmAll-CLI.exe

[IV] How to Deheader ROMs
---------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1)
Put your ROMs into your ROMs directory. DeheadEmAll is recursive. You can put ROMs into sub directories.

Step 2)
If you like using a graphical interface, run the DeheadEmAll GUI, check the ROMs that you want to deheader and click the Dehead ROMs button to deheader all of your ROMs.

If you like using a command line interface, run the DeheadEmAll CLI directly or use some of the provided Windows Batch files to deheader all of your ROMs. Optionally, you may pass commands and options to the DeheadEmAll CLI. The proper syntax and help is available with the -help command.
